# Order2Cook

This is the front-end for a system that will allow users to take orders for food items, receive those same orders for food items, and maintain a simple inventory.

## Next Development Steps

Work on allowing edits/deletions of items in confirmation list, then work on navigation menu for manual searching.

Currently trying to find a way to actually change the ordered qty in the confirmation list.  So far, I don't
seem to know what event to bind to - just typing in that field doesn't seem to set off anything.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
